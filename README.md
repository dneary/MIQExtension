MIQExtension
============

MIQExtension is a rule-set for ManageIQ which contains common VM placement rules, including:
* Ensure that two VMs are launched on different hosts
* Share load evenly
* Minimise number of hosts used up to a capacity limit
* High priority VMs get dedicated resources

Installation
------------

Download miqextension.xml and import it from the ManageIQ dashboard.

The rulesets can now be applied to one or more VMs via the Control module.

IMPORTANT: This is a sample project, instructions are dummy text which looks like it might be reasonable.
